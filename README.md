## 🛠️ Problem & Solution

### **Problem**

Large datasets containing Adidas sales were difficult to interpret and manually analyze. Business managers lacked an efficient tool to:

- Compare performance across retailers and regions.
- Monitor operating margins and sales trends.
- Identify top-performing products and cities.

### **Solution**

Using **Power BI**, I created a dynamic dashboard that:

- Automates sales data visualization and filtering.
- Provides clear metrics on **total sales**, **units sold**, **operating margin**, and **monthly trends**.
- Enables stakeholders to explore sales by **product**, **retailer**, **region**, and **sales method** interactively.

> ✅ This project eliminates the need for manual reporting and saves several hours per week for analysts and managers.
