## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights that aid in decision-making, uncover regional performance disparities, and track monthly trends. It demonstrates the ability to analyze, clean, and present large-scale business data in a clear and meaningful way.

## 🛠️ Problem & Solution

### **Problem**

Large datasets containing Adidas sales were difficult to interpret and manually analyze. Business managers lacked an efficient tool to:

- Compare performance across retailers and regions.
- Monitor operating margins and sales trends.
- Identify top-performing products and cities.

### **Solution**

Using **Power BI**, I created a dynamic dashboard that:

- Automates sales data visualization and filtering.
- Provides clear metrics on **total sales**, **units sold**, **operating margin**, and **monthly trends**.
- Enables stakeholders to explore sales by **product**, **retailer**, **region**, and **sales method** interactively.

> ✅ This project eliminates the need for manual reporting and saves several hours per week for analysts and managers.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Rationale

- **Power BI**  
  Chosen for its powerful data visualization features, user-friendly interface, and seamless DAX support.

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**  
  Used to create calculated columns and measures such as operating margin and dynamic time trends.

- **Power Query**  
  Utilized for transforming, cleaning, and preparing the data before modeling.

- **Microsoft Excel**  
  The original dataset was sourced from Excel – a common format in most business environments.

> 🧩 These tools were selected for their **robust analytical capabilities**, **business relevance**, and **ease of use**.
